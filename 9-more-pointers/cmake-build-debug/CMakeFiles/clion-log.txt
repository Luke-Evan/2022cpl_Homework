CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() argv is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() argv.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" argv on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
